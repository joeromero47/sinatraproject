# Video Game Library Organizer 

The video game library organizer is an application I built to organize your video games that you own and list what platform you own them on. This application is useful to make sure you do not purchase the same game again if you own games on several different platforms.

## Installation

Visit https://github.com/joeromero47/sinatraproject to download the project. 

## Usage
Start program by running shotgun. The program will prompt you to log in or sign in when you direct your browser to localhost:9393. Follow the url links to sign up and then log in when it directs you to the log in page. At your games/index page you will see an empty list as a new user since you have yet to add any games. Simply click on add a new game and you will be able to enter a name and platform the game is on. Clicking submit will save it to your list. Clicking the name on the list will allow you to edit the game or delete it. Log out when finished.
